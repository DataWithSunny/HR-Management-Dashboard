Project Description

Developed an interactive HR Management Dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze workforce data and support strategic HR decision-making. The dashboard provides end-to-end visibility into employee demographics, hiring trends, attrition, and performance metrics across multiple years (2015–2018).

The project involved collecting and cleaning raw HR data, defining key HR KPIs, and designing visual reports to track active employees, new hires, separations, turnover, tenure, and workforce distribution by gender, age group, ethnicity, region, and employment type (Full-Time, Part-Time, Hourly, Salary).

Advanced Excel features such as Pivot Tables, Pivot Charts, slicers, formulas, and conditional formatting were used to create dynamic and user-friendly dashboards. The analysis helped identify turnover trends, bad hires, regional workforce distribution, and diversity patterns, enabling HR teams to improve hiring strategies, retention planning, and workforce optimization.

Key Metrics Analyzed :-
Employee Headcount & Active Employees
New Hires vs Separations
Voluntary & Involuntary Turnover
Average Tenure (FT / PT)
Workforce Demographics (Age, Gender, Ethnicity)
Regional & Business Unit Distribution

Tools & Skills Used:- MS Excel, Data Cleaning, Pivot Tables, Dashboards, KPI Analysis, HR Analytics, Data Visualization
